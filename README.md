# Satisfactory Planner

This is mostly just a Proof-of-Concept repo that I want to do something in. I'm making it public because there's nothing particularly secretive about what I am doing.

## Q: There are already a bunch of other Calculators for the game; why _another_ one?

How I build factories I sometimes want to know how many of an item, say rotors, I could build off a certain number of resources, i.e. "If I have 240 Iron Ore per minute, how many Rotors could this make?" While rotors aren't the most complicated thing to make, it can quickly become a lot of math, prone to errors when trying to look at more complicated items. 

## Q: Do you plan on hosting this?

Yes, likely as a subdomain on my personal website. I will update once everything is deployed and working as expected.
